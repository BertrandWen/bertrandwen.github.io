Here are some works of mine :books:

## Projects

<ProjectCard hideBorder=true>

  **1. A steganography scheme based on adversarial examples (master thesis)**

  In this work, we regard the adversarial nature of the adversarial
  examples itself as information, which can be decoded by the specific model only.

  **2. Multi-task Learning for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (bachelor thesis)**

  This work proposes a deep multi-task learning framework for aspect term extraction (ATE). Furthermore, it presents a novel way to combines aspect term extraction and aspect sentiment classification into an individual task, which can avoid the error propagation from the pipeline approach.
